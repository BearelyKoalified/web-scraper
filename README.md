# web-scraper
Web scraper of FreeCodecamp usernames, likes, and challenges completed using Cheerio, Request, and cli-table for table printout

Node_modules included as to run simply with 'node index.js'
Alternatively, simply pull index.js and run 'npm install request cheerio cli-table -save'

Challenges column currently broken - need to fix
//h1.landing-heading always true but counting 'tbody tr' pattern isn't finding any when they do exist...
